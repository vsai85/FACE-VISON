# ðŸŽ­ Real-Time Emotion Detection System

## ðŸ§  Overview
This project is a **Real-Time Emotion Detection System** that identifies human emotions from facial expressions using **Deep Learning** and **Computer Vision** techniques.  
It leverages the **DeepFace** framework with **OpenCV** for real-time image processing and **Streamlit** for an interactive user interface.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Real-time emotion detection through webcam or uploaded images  
- Supports multiple emotions: *Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Fear, Disgust, Neutral*  
- Confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score visualization  
- Lightweight model optimized for faster inference  
- Can be extended to multi-modal emotion recognition (facial + audio)
